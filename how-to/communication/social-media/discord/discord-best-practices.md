# üëç Discord Best Practices

* If you post links: What's your take/summary/learning from this? What's the To-Do here?
* Stay in the relevant channel with your topics.
* Avoid "non-informative answers" like agreeing and use thumbs up emojis instead
* Ask the channel creator to update the first pinned message with summarized relevant information about the channel
* Debate less how and do more, often "done" is better than "perfect"
* Tell others what you are working on to avoid duplication and to increase efficiency of project management
