# ðŸª™ Quests and Tokens

CureDAO is built on the [Aragon](https://client.aragon.org/#/pcuredao/) DAO platform. The unit of democratic power in CureDAO is the PCUREDAO tokens on the Polygon blockchain.

PCUREDAO tokens give you control over CureDAO and how it allocates its resources.

PCUREDAO tokens are awarded for the completion of quests and experiments that advance the CureDAO mission. Quests and Experiments are outlined in Clickup Tasks.
