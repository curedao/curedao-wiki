<p>The Crowdsourcing Cures Wiki is an open content platform whose quality and accuracy directly depend on the participation of our users. Contributions of any kind are always appreciated and we encourage you to get involved (<a href="mailto:hello@crowdsourcingcures.org">ask</a> the team for help getting started)!</p>
<p>Our primary methods of collaboration include:</p>

- creating new articles in accordance with the community guidelines</li>
- improving upon existing articles by adding content, removing errors, checking grammar and spelling, and adding 
missing citations from reliable sources (please refer to our [style guide](writing-style-guide.md))
- engaging in constructive discussion in comments, our [Discord forum](https://discord.gg/vxdfpqdjag), user 
profiles, or by [emailing](mailto:hello@crowdsourcingcures.org)
us directly
- helping our project grow through donations
