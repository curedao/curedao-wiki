The platform will consist of two primary components:

1. **Core Framework** - This will be open-source and include only universally necessary features.  This primarily consists of user authentication, data owner access controls, data storage, data validation, and an API for storage and retrieval. The DAO will compensate contributors to the core platform.
2. **Plugins** - These will be modules that provide additional functionality data import from specific sources, data mapping to various formats, data analysis, data visualization, notifications. These may be free or monetized by their creator.

## Technical Framework

### 1. Data Ingestion API (core component)

Challenge: To acquire, extract, transform, and normalize the countless unstandardized data export file formats and data structures and load them into a standardized structure that can be easily analyzed to derive clinical insight.

Approach: We will develop an application programming interface (API) and OpenAPI specification for receiving and sharing data with the core database.  Software development kits (SDK’s) will be made available for 3rd party applications to use to interact with the API. Plugins will enable spreadsheet upload/import and scheduled imports from existing third-party APIs.

Impact: The API connector framework will allow the ongoing regular import of user data after a single user authorization.  SDK’s will enable developers to implement easy automatic sharing options in their applications. An increase in the quantity of data will produce a proportional increase in the number of clinical discoveries made.

### 2. Raw Data Storage (core component)

Data will be encrypted stored in its raw format in flat files on a secure cloud provider defined in the framework instance platform settings.  Preservation of the data in its original format will allow for:

1. Asynchronous Queued Data Parsing Jobs - This is necessary to allow for the data to be parsed in parallel offline and avoid overloading the webserver.
2. Storage of data incompatible with a time-series relational data store.
3. Storage of data formats that do not yet have defined parser plugins.  This will allow for the data to be imported at a later date when the data mapper has been defined.
4. Updating parsers to support changes in the response format for a particular API.

### 3. Data Mappers (core components and plugins)

These will be executed in an asynchronous queue to map the raw data to a standardized format and provide it to the validator.  The most common data mappers will be defined in the framework. Less common data mappers will be available as plugins from 3rd party developers.

TODO: Determine core data mappers

### 4. Data Validation (core component)

The data validation middleware will validate the data before it is stored in the relational database.  It
will be responsible for ensuring that the data is in a consistent format and that it is not malformed. It
will also ensure that values are within the expected range for a given variable or unit.

### 5. Relational Time Series Data Storage (core component)

After validation and mapping, time-series data will be stored in a relational database.  The use of a
relational data store with defined foreign key relationships will ensure atomicity and data veracity.

### 6. Data Owner Dashboard (core component)

A data owner dashboard will allow them to manage their data and access control settings. It will allow them to:

- view their data and the OAuth clients with access to it
- modify read/write permissions for specific OAuth clients
- restrict access to their data to specific users and groups
- delete data
- view their current compensation balance and make withdrawals
- update their profile information
- configure 2-factor authentication

## Research Platform

## Plugin Types

Plugins will be stored in their own repositories based on a plugin template repository.  The plugin template
repository will contain defined interfaces required for interoperability with the core framework.

### 1. Data Analysis Plugins

Challenge: To quantify the effectiveness of treatments for specific individuals, reveal hidden factors exacerbating their illness, and determine personalized optimal daily values for these factors.

Approach: We will develop time-series machine learning algorithms to

- quantify the effect size of all factors on symptom severity
- determine the optimal daily dosage of
  nutrients, sleep, exercise, medications, and other factors necessary to minimize symptom severity.

Impact: This will mitigate the incidence of chronic illnesses by informing the user of symptom triggers, such as dietary sensitivities, to be avoided. This will also assist patients and clinicians in assessing the effectiveness of treatments despite the hundreds of uncontrollable variables in any prescriptive experiment.

### 2. Data Visualization

Data visualization plugin modules will be utilized to visualize the data from a given subject or group in a meaningful
way.  Visualizations may be displayed in studies or on the data owner dashboard.

#### Example Visualizations

Currently, all foods carry nutrition labels such as this one:

![](https://crowdsourcingcures.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/nutrition-label-436x1024-1.jpg)

But how useful is it to the average person to know the amount of Riboflavin in something? The purpose of nutritional labels is to help individuals make choices that will improve their health and prevent disease.

Telling the average person the amount of riboflavin in something isn’t going to achieve this. This is evidenced by the fact that these labels have existed for decades and during this time, we’ve only seen increases in most diseases they were intended to reduce.

We have created a new and improved **Outcomes Label** that instead lists the degree to which the product is likely
to improve or worsen specific health outcomes or symptoms. We currently have generated Outcome Labels for thousands
of foods, drugs, and nutritional supplements that can be found at [Journal of Citizen Science](https://studies.crowdsourcingcures.org/). These labels are derived from the analysis of 10 million data points anonymously donated by over 10,000 study participants via [our web app](https://app.crowdsourcingcures.org/?swcfpc=1#/app/intro).

#### Data Quantity Required for Outcome Labels

The Foundation has collected over 10 million data points on symptom severity and influencing factors from over 10,000 people. The Foundation develops and applies predictive machine learning algorithms to the data to reveal the effectiveness and side-effects of treatments and the degree to which hidden dietary and environmental improve or exacerbate chronic illnesses

These analytical results have been used to freely publish 90,000 studies on the effects of various treatments and food ingredients on symptom severity.

![](https://crowdsourcingcures.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/johnny-5-need-input.gif)

Although 10 million data points sound like a lot, currently, the usefulness and accuracy of these Outcome Labels are currently limited. This is due to the fact there are only a few study participants have donated data for a particular food paired with a particular symptom. In observational research such as this, a very large number of participants are required to cancel out all the errors and coincidences that can influence the data for a single individual.

For instance, someone with depression may have started taking an antidepressant at the same time they started seeing a therapist. Then, if their depression improves, it’s impossible to know if the improvement was a result of the antidepressant, the therapist, both, or something else. These random factors are known as confounding variables. However, random confounding factors can cancel each other out when looking at large data sets. This is why it’s important to collect as much data as possible.

#### Data Sources for Outcome Labels

Several types of data are used to derive the Outcome Labels:

1. **Individual Micro-Level Data** – This could include data manually entered or imported from other devices or apps
   in [our app](http://app.crowdsourcingcures.org/?swcfpc=1), This could also include shopping receipts for foods,
   drugs, or nutritional supplements purchased and insurance claim data.
2. **Macro-Level Epidemiological Data** – This includes the incidence of various diseases over time combined with data on the amounts of different drugs or food additives. This is how it was initially discovered that smoking caused lung cancer. With macro-level data, it’s even harder to distinguish correlation from causation. However, different countries often enact different policies that can serve as very useful natural experiments. For instance, 30 countries have banned the use of glyphosate. If the rates of Alzheimer’s, autism, and depression declined in these countries and did not decline in the countries still using glyphosate, this would provide very powerful evidence regarding its effects. Unfortunately, there is no global database that currently provides easy access to the incidence of these conditions in various countries over time and the levels of exposure to various chemicals.
3. **Clinical Trial Data** – This is the gold standard with regard to the level of confidence that a factor is truly the cause of an outcome. However, it’s also the most expensive to collect. As a result, clinical trials are often very small (less than 50 people). Exclusion criteria in trials often prevent study participants from being representative of real patients. There are ethical considerations that prevent us from running trials that have any risk of harm to participants. Due to the expense involved, we have very few trials run on anything other than a molecule that can be patented and sold as a drug.

### 3. API Connectors

API Connector plugins will be called by the webserver to:

1. handle the OAuth2 authorization flow and store their credentials in the relational database
2. provide the original raw response to the framework for encryption and storage

A job scheduler will call the API connectors periodically (usually daily) to:

1. Refresh the user's OAuth access token
2. Fetch new data or data that has been modified since the last import
3. Map the response to the standard format as defined by the OpenAPI specification for the framework API
4. Provide the processed data to the framework's validation middleware.
5. All valid data will be stored in the relational database. Otherwise, the data will be rejected and the plugin developer and data owner will be notified.

### 4. Spreadsheet and PDF Importers

Upon upload, the webserver will call the File Importer plugin:

1. Provide the original file to the framework for encryption and storage
2. Add the file to a queue for processing by the job scheduler
   The background job scheduler will:
3. Retrieve the file from the encrypted storage
4. Extract the data from the file
5. Mapped to the standard format as defined by the framework OpenAPI specification
6. The processed data will be provided to the framework's validation middleware.
7. Valid data will be stored in the relational database.
8. Invalid data from the plugin will be rejected and the plugin developer and data owner will be notified.
