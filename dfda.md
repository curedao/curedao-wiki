## Mandate
Maximimize average healthy human lifespan by identifying  discovering and disemminating the effects of every food, additive, supplement, and medical intervention while minimizing costs to consumers.

## Overview
The Decentralized FDA is meant to act as a regulatory template or platonic ideal based on crowdsourced best practices for food and drug regulation and compliance. It is meant to be forked, modified where needed, and implemented in various micro-nations, network states, or special economic zones.  

## Hypotheses

1. Given a clear and optimized mandate, the crowd wisdom of a large body of medical experts can produce policies that are more effective at extending healthy human lifespan than the current regulatory framework.
2. It is possible to implement such a regulatory body in a micro-state or economic zone such as Prospera, a semi-autonomous jurisdiction in Honduras.
3. Evidence of the success of this model will make it possible to promote adoption by other micro-nations.
4. Evidence of the success of this model will make it possible to promote adoption by increasingly larger states.

## Objective:  Increase Access to Healing 

- Elevate the most promising yet little known/researched treatments
- Issue certifications for the Decentralized Science web-of-trust
- Provide an API for building trust worthy alternatives to conventional health markets

### Roadmap

1.  Contract Research Organization: Perform research for DAOs and corporations alike. Focus on early stage and replication experiements. Trials run out of Prospera or in a decentralized manner.

2. Cerifying Agency: 
	- Certify safety and efficacy ratings; using a gradient rather than simple pass or fail.  
	- Approve proposed experiments (Institutional Review Board).
	- Certify named and pseudonymous participants in DeSci/Biomedicine, allowing a web-of-trust to develop.
	
3. Regulatory Agency:
	- Provide a Web3 API for market places
	- Certify producers, distributors, and recipients of treatments 
	- Build a knowledge graph from 'confirmed' treatment recipients 
	- Certifications for 'bad actors' may be revoked
    
    
### Legal Structures

*'Co' is intentionally amibigous; may refer to a cooperative, a collective, and a company.*

- Cooperative to own the health data collectively; pool with other aligned orgs to create a massive data set owned by the participants 
- Non-profit to issue certifications and publish code/standards (limited liability through Wyoming non-profit)
- For profit(s) to run experiments and collaborate with other corporations to commercialize therapeutics when feasible


## Continuous Improvement
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) should be monitored in the jurisdictions where each fork is applied.  This will allow for A/B testing of the outcomes of particular policies and statutes that differ among forks.  

## Governance
The policies of dFDA can be submitted and ratified using a Futarchical Voting mechanism whereby votes are weighted based on the voter's historical record of voting on proposals linked to improvements in outcome KPIs. 

### Benefits to Board Members
 - Elevated on-chain reputation for prediction accuracy
 - Gains from futures market

## Functions and Components
1. **Comparative Policy Analysis** - Aggregate existing approval and certification data from existing national regulatory bodies
2. **Food and Drug Outcome Labels** - Aggregate and analyze real-world data (RWD) to create Outcome Labels subject to Futarchical-weighted review by the board members of the dFDA
3. **Publish Meta-Analyses** - Generate meta-analyses from all completed studies at ClinicalTrials.gov
4. **DeSci Exchange** - A free market for personal data in the form of an embeddable SDK with a configurable transaction fee for the apps embedding it. 
5. **Human File System Protocol and SDK** - A standard protocol for personal data exchange betweeen studies, apps and devices. 
6. **Digital Twin Safe** - A tool for self-sovereign storage of personal data that enables effortless data sharing with clinical safety and efficacy studies.


## A Futarchy-Based Meritocratic Regulatory Framework

Medical experts will receive soul-bound non-transferable deFDA Credential NFTs (FDA-CRED) will be issued to all members of the American Medical Association (AMA) and other international bodies which verify medical credentialing.

One deFDA fungible Reputation Token (FDA-REP) will be airdropped to holder of FDA-NFTs for each intervention that is proposed for a specified population.

Medical experts can stake their token in one of three pools based on their belief for the experimental population relative to a control group not exposed to the intervention:

1. "Uncertain Pool" - they are uncertain of the outcome of the reform
2. "Harmful Pool" - reform will result in a relative net average DECREASE in healthspan
3. "Helpful Pool" - reform will result in a relative net average INCREASE in healthspan

If they do nothing, it will be assumed that they did not review the proposal.

If the "Helpful Pool" is the majority, the proposal will be approved and implemented. Post-marketing pharmaco-vigilence data will be collected from the participants and used to determine the relative change in healthspan between affected and unaffected populations.
