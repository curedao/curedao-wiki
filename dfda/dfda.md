# The Decentralized FDA

## Mandate
Maximimize average healthy human lifespan by identifying  discovering and disemminating the effects of every food, additive, supplement, and medical intervention while minimizing costs to consumers.

## Overview
The Decentralized FDA is meant to act as a regulatory template or platonic ideal based on crowdsourced best practices for food and drug regulation and compliance. It is meant to be forked, modified where needed, and implemented in various micro-nations, network states, or special economic zones.  

## Continuous Improvement
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) should be monitored in the jurisdictions where each fork is applied.  This will allow for A/B testing of the outcomes of particular policies and statutes that differ among forks.  

## Governance
The policies of dFDA can be submitted and ratified using a Futarchical Voting mechanism whereby votes are weighted based on the voter's historical record of voting on proposals linked to improvements in outcome KPIs. 

## Functions and Components
1. **Comparative Policy Analysis** - Aggregate existing approval and certification data from existing national regulatory bodies
2. **[Publish Personalized Outcome Labels](/plugins/outcome-labels-plugin)** - Aggregate and analyze real-world data (RWD) to create Outcome Labels subject to Futarchical-weighted review by the board members of the dFDA
3. **Publish Meta-Analyses** - Generate meta-analyses from all completed studies at ClinicalTrials.gov
4. **Govern the DeSci Exchange** - A free market for personal data in the form of an embeddable SDK with a configurable transaction fee for the apps embedding it. 
5. **Establish the Human File System Protocol and SDK** - A standard protocol for personal data exchange betweeen studies, apps and devices. 
6. **Digital Twin Safe** - A tool for self-sovereign storage of personal data that enables effortless data sharing with clinical safety and efficacy studies.
