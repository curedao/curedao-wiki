<h1>IC50</h1><div class="mw-parser-output"><p>The <b>half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>)</b> is a measure of the potency of a substance in inhibiting a specific biological or biochemical function. 
</p><p>IC<sub>50</sub> is a quantitative measure that indicates how much of a particular inhibitory substance (e.g. drug) is needed to inhibit, <i>in vitro</i>, a given biological process or biological component by 50%. The biological component could be an enzyme, cell, cell receptor or microorganism. IC<sub>50</sub> values are typically expressed as molar concentration.
</p><p>The <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://wiki.crowdsourcingcures.org/wiki/IC50">IC50</a> value is inversely proportional to its strength. The higher the IC50 value, the smaller the strength of the drug, and vice versa.
