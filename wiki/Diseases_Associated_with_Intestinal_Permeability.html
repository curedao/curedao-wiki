<h1>Diseases Associated with Intestinal Permeability</h1><div class="mw-parser-output"><p>A critical function of the intestinal mucosa, particularly the epithelium, is to form a barrier that prevents potentially noxious contents of the intestinal lumen, including the microbiota, from accessing internal sites and the systemic circulation. Barrier defects have been reliably associated with a variety of human diseases, including those primarily affecting the gut, e.g. 
</p>
<ul><li>inflammatory bowel disease (IBD),</li>
<li>celiac disease,</li>
<li>irritable bowel syndrome</li></ul>
<p>as well as systemic diseases or diseases involving other organ systems, e.g.
</p>
<ul><li>type I diabetes</li>
<li>graft versus host disease (GVHD)</li>
<li>HIV</li>
<li>multiple sclerosis</li>
<li>rheumatoid arthritis</li>
<li>autism</li></ul>
<p>The topic is further confused by use of the term 'leaky gut syndrome' within the lay and alternative medicine communities, and even by some physicians, and claims that this is responsible for a dizzying array of disorders, including 
</p>
<ul><li>chronic fatigue syndrome</li>
<li>fibromyalgia</li>
<li>allergies</li>
<li>depression</li>
<li>skin disorders</li></ul>

<p>In humans, intestinal permeability increases with age43, and elderly individuals show an association between increased LPS-binding protein (a marker of microbial translocation) and inflammation. Moreover, a recent study involving postmortem brain tissue from patients with AD showed that LPS and gram-negative <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> fragments co-localize with amyloid plaques. Thus, increased abundance of gram-negative intestinal bacteria such as <i>Bacteroides</i> in participants with AD may result in increased translocation of LPS from the gut to systemic circulation, which in turn may contribute to or exacerbate AD pathology through inflammation or other mechanisms.
</p><p>Additionally, compared to control participants, AD participants in our study exhibited decreased Actinobacteria. These differences were mostly driven by changes in <i>Bifidobacterium</i>. Actinobacteria, particularly members of the <i>Bifidobacterium</i> genus, are an important bacterial inhabitant of the human gut across the lifespan, and their beneficial health effects have been well-documented. In particular, certain species of <i>Bifidobacterium</i> are associated with anti-inflammatory properties and decreased intestinal permeability.
