<h1>Terminology</h1>
<h3>Investment Multiple&nbsp;</h3>
<p>The investment multiple is also known as the total value to paid-in (TVPI) multiple. It is calculated by dividing the fund's cumulative distributions and residual value by the paid-in capital. It provides insight into the fund's performance by showing the fund's total value as a multiple of its cost basis. It does not take into account the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/03/082703.asp">time value of money</a>.</p>
