<h1>Relative Nutritional Deficiency</h1><div class="mw-parser-output"><p>Relative Nutritional Deficiency (RND) occurs when specific nutrients which work together to perform a function are individually within the normal range but are abnormally high or low in relation to one another. </p><blockquote><p>Two primary categories of nutritional deficiency exist:</p>
<ol><li><p><b>Absolute Nutritional Deficiency</b> - Insufficient dietary nutrient intake causes absolute nutritional deficiencies. An absolute nutritional deficiency can be corrected by optimizing nutrient intake in the diet. Management of the problem is often enhanced by the administration of nutritional supplements, but they are not required.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Relative Nutritional Deficiency (RND) -</b> Specific nutrients which work together to perform a function are individually within the normal range but are abnormally high or low in relation to one another. One example of this is seen with sodium to potassium ratio's.&#160; Excess potassium in relationship to sodium could cause dizzy spells or low <a href="https://wiki.crowdsourcingcures.org/wiki/Blood_Pressure" title="Blood Pressure">blood pressure</a> and is too be avoided While lowering sodium intake is seen as desirable as high sodium is strongly associated with high blood pressure. The balance point between each nutrient is specific for correct function. </p><p>The monoamine-associated RND is by far the most prevalent constellation of nutritional deficiencies found in humans. It is postulated that over 80% of humans suffer from symptoms relating to a serotonin and/or catecholamine RND. Conditions prior to in situ <a href="https://wiki.crowdsourcingcures.org/wiki/Monoamine_transporter_optimization" title="Monoamine transporter optimization">monoamine transporter optimization</a> (MTO, referred to in some previous papers as OCT <a href="https://wiki.crowdsourcingcures.org/index.php?title=Functional_status_optimization&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Functional status optimization (page does not exist)">functional status optimization</a>) made it impossible to achieve consistent results with the administration of monoamine amino acid precursors. With the invention and refinement of MTO, the ability to study, manipulate, and optimally manage monoamine-related RND became clinically possible.</p></li></ol></blockquote>

<p id="&#95;_p94" class="p p-last">The dosing values of 5-HTP, L-dopa, and L-tyrosine are independent of each other. Some variability in the high-end range values may occur when individual RND-associated disease states are examined versus this entire group of diseases. Using L-tyrosine as an example, dosing values of 14,000 mg per day were unknown in the literature prior to this research. However, when amino acid dosing values are established with MTO, these seemingly high doses are uniformly well tolerated by patients, because electrical flow and the system revert back to normal.</p><p><a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3355850/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3355850/</a></p></blockquote>

Subjects also received the following daily dosing values of cofactors: 1) 1000 mg vitamin C, 2) 220 mg calcium citrate, 3) 75 mg vitamin B6, and 4) 400 Î¼g folate.</p><blockquote><p>It takes up to 5 days for the maximum benefit of an amino acid dosing change to be seen.
</p><p>As neurotransmitter levels increase with amino acid precursor administration, drug side effects may occur in ~5% of patients.
</p><p>L-dopa and l-tyrosine have an ability to deplete sulfur amino acids. Based on previous experience and peer-reviewed literature, l-cysteine was added to the serotonin and dopamine amino acid precursors in the amounts of 4500 mg/day in adults in divided doses. Selenium 400 mcg/day was administered with the l-cysteine to address concerns raised in the literature regarding l-cysteine facilitating neurotoxic insult by methylmercury. Other literature notes that selenium irreversibly binds to methylmercury rendering it nontoxic.
