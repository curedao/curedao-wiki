<h1>Techniques for Dealing With Negative Thoughts and Emotions</h1><div class="mw-parser-output"><p>High-level principles for dealing with all sorts of 'active' negative thoughts and emotions, such as anger, worry, stress, resentment, grief, self-hate, etc. You might even call it an 'algorithm'. Note that it doesn't really work for 'passive' negative emotions such as <a href="https://wiki.crowdsourcingcures.org/wiki/Anhedonia" title="Anhedonia">anhedonia</a> or low motivation and drive.
</p><p>It's often more helpful to do the steps below in <i>written</i> format. Writing is often more effective than mere thinking or talking.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="There_is_nothing_either_good_or_bad_but_thinking_makes_it_so">There is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so</span></h2>
<p>This principle lies at the core of stoicism, cognitive behavioral therapy as well as Buddhism. Suffering is not caused by external events, but by how one <i>cognitively interpret</i>s such events. Exceptions include torture, I guess.
</p>
<h2><span id="Identify_dysfunctional,_negative_thoughts._Hint:_'Shoulding'_at_oneself,_others_or_the_universe"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="Identify_dysfunctional.2C_negative_thoughts._Hint:_.C3.A2.E2.82.AC.C5.93Shoulding.C3.A2.E2.82.AC.EF.BF.BD_at_oneself.2C_others_or_the_universe">Identify dysfunctional, negative thoughts. Hint: '<i>Shoulding</i>' at oneself, others or the universe</span></h2>
<p><i>Identify</i> the dysfunctional, negative thoughts underlying your current negative state of mind. 
</p><p>Negative thoughts are usually triggered by shortcomings of: 
</p>
<ol><li>oneself</li>
<li>others</li>
<li>the universe</li></ol>
<p>They are often characterized by dogmatic demands ('<i>musts'</i> or '<i>shoulds'</i>) directed at oneself, others and/or the universe. They often take the following form: 'X <i>should</i> not be! It's so bad and unfair! X means that I'm rotten / others are rotten / the universe is rotten!' 
</p>
<h2><span id="Do_your_thoughts_help_you_to_achieve_your_goals?"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="Do_your_thoughts_help_you_to_achieve_your_goals.3F">Do your thoughts help you to achieve your goals?</span></h2>
<p>Once identified, ask yourself if these negative thoughts <i>help</i> you to achieve your goals. If not, it's instrumentally rational to try to overcome them (or at least cling to them less). 
</p>
<h2><span id="Have_the_serenity_to_accept_what_you_cannot_change,_the_courage_to_change_what_you_can,_and_the_wisdom_to_know_the_difference"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="Have_the_serenity_to_accept_what_you_cannot_change.2C_the_courage_to_change_what_you_can.2C_and_the_wisdom_to_know_the_difference">Have the serenity to accept what you cannot change, the courage to change what you can, and the wisdom to know the difference</span></h2>
<p>Stoicism, Buddhism and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) all advocate the importance of the following principle: 
</p><p>a) Focus your efforts only on changing the things you <i>can</i> change.
</p><p>b) Learn to <i>accept</i> the things you <i>cannot</i> change.
</p><p>It's important to distinguish the two and apply different strategies. Trying to change the latter only causes pointless frustration, while accepting the former limits your potential.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Reinterpret_reality_more_positively">Reinterpret reality more positively</span></h2>
<p>Often, we can reinterpret reality more positively. I find the following algorithm useful:
</p>
<ul><li>You are faced with X; a shortcoming of yourself, others or the universe in general. For example, your mediocre writing abilities.</li>
<li>Naturally, we compare the current, suboptimal world to a <i>better</i> world, more in line with one's preferences, e.g. one in which you're a better writer.</li>
<li>However, instead of comparing our world to a better world, we could also compare our world to a <i>worse</i> world, e.g. one in which one is an even worse writer.</li>
<li>Generally, instead of focusing on how this world is less than perfect, one should try to focus on how this world is a lot better than the worst possible world.</li></ul>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="The_multiverse_meditation._Or_how_to_accept_everything">The <i>multiverse meditation.</i> Or how to accept everything</span></h2>
<p>Admittedly, the above paragraphs can be boiled down to the rather trite advice of 'looking on the bright side of life'.
</p><p>If such a simple positive reinterpretation fails, I use a technique I call 'multiverse meditation'. It's better for me than meditation because it's more logical or 'rational'. The more perceptual, instinctive acceptance trained via meditation seems less suited to me. I want to have a ironclad <i>reason</i> for why I should accept all the shitty things of life.
</p><p>The multiverse meditation, basically a visualization of what it means to live in an infinite multiverse and use updateless decision theory, goes like this:
</p><p>Almost all of your copies â€“ or, to be more precise, almost all instantiations of your decision algorithm â€“ will live in parts of the multiverse where things will turn out suboptimal at times, sometimes extremely so. 3 This is an inevitable fact of reality. You can either accept this or kill yourself right now. But choosing to adopt the decision algorithm to get angry, upset, resentful, depressed, etc. when one is confronted with suboptimal circumstances (hypocritical people, stupid bureaucracies, 'unfair' diseases, etc.) is simply irrational. By adopting such a policy, you condemn every copy of yourself â€“ except those living in the infinitesimally rare, 'perfect' parts of the multiverse â€“ &#160;to become depressed and eventually burn out, when the universe inevitably won't align perfectly with your preferences.4
</p><p>Another corollary of the multiverse meditation can also be helpful and fill you with hope, at least it does so for me: In some parts of the multiverse, everything will go extremely well, i.e. the future will be downright utopian. Naturally, the reverse corollary is also true. Do your best to not think about this one.

<p>Many find the following existential outlook very motivating: 'Life is a game. Win it by achieving your goals.'
</p><p>Personally, I don't find this perspective very appealing.
</p><p>First of all, the player character sucks. In all of my favorite games, you're playing a hero with many extraordinary powers, defeat ultimate evil and save the world. In the real world, I'm neither a hero nor a genius. Not only don't I have any unique powers, my abilities are generally laughable. I can't summon fireballs, however small. Heck, most of the time I have trouble disposing of the garbage or responding to emails. Transforming the world according to my preferences is extremely difficult.
</p><p>Second, the game is fundamentally unwinnable in the sense that I can't fully achieve my goals. Take one of my central goals: reducing suffering. Sure, I can contribute to the reduction of suffering in the multiverse. But I can never actually *end* suffering. Furthermore, my counterfactual impact is preposterously low. Imagine a game in which you can reduce the final boss' health points by 0.000001% at most â€“ but he will never die. No one would play such a game.
