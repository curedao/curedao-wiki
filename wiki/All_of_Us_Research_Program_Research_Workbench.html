<h1>All of Us Research Program Research Workbench</h1><div class="mw-parser-output"><p>Currently, access to the <a href="https://wiki.crowdsourcingcures.org/wiki/All_of_Us_Research_Program" title="All of Us Research Program">All of Us</a> Research Workbench is only available to individuals with an email address associated with an approved institution.  However, they are trying to figure out how to enable citizen scientists not associated with a university to access it.

<p>The source code for the research workbench is available at <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/all-of-us">https://github.com/all-of-us</a>.  This appears to be an organization containing internal code not accepting outside contributions. 
</p><p>There's another "<a href="https://wiki.crowdsourcingcures.org/wiki/All_of_Us_Research_Program" title="All of Us Research Program">All of Us Research Program</a>" Github organization at <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/All-of-Us-Research-Program">https://github.com/All-of-Us-Research-Program</a>.  It's unclear what differentiates these two organizations.
