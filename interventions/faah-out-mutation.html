<h1>How the FAAH gene increases pain sensitivity</h1>
<ol>
  <li>The FAAH (<strong>fatty acid amide hydrolase)</strong> gene encodes for the FAAH enzyme.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>FAAH normally degrades anandamide (<i>a fatty acid neurotransmitter</i>) into <i>free arachidonic acid</i> and <i>ethanolamine</i>.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Without <i>FAAH</i>, the levels of anandamide would increase significantly.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>This, in turn, leads to a reduced pain sensation.</li>
  <li><i>FAAH</i> knockout mice demonstrated not only the absence of pain but reduced anxiety and faster wound healing as well.<strong><sup>2,3</sup></strong></li>
</ol>
<h1>Case report: Microdeletion in a <i>FAAH</i> pseudogene identified in a patient with high anandamide concentrations and pain insensitivity</h1>
<blockquote>
  <p>The study of rare families with inherited <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/analgesia-sensory-dysfunction">pain insensitivity</a> can identify new human-validated <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/anodyne">analgesic drug</a> targets.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Here, a 66-yr-old female presented with nil requirement for <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/postoperative-analgesia">postoperative analgesia</a> after a normally painful orthopaedic hand surgery (trapeziectomy). Further investigations revealed a lifelong history of painless injuries, such as frequent cuts and burns, which were observed to heal quickly.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>We report the causative mutations for this new pain insensitivity disorder:&nbsp;</p>
  <p>the co-inheritance of&nbsp;</p>
  <p>(i) a microdeletion in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/dorsal-root">dorsal root</a> <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/ganglion">ganglia</a> and brain-expressed <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/pseudogene">pseudogene</a>, <i>FAAH-OUT</i>, which we cloned from the fatty-acid amide hydrolase (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/fatty-acid-amidase"><i>FAAH</i></a>) chromosomal region; and</p>
  <p>(ii) a common functional single-nucleotide polymorphism in <i>FAAH</i> conferring reduced expression and activity.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Circulating concentrations of <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/anandamide">anandamide</a> and related fatty-acid <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/carboxamide">amides</a> (palmitoylethanolamide and oleoylethanolamine) that are all normally degraded by FAAH were significantly elevated in peripheral blood compared with normal control carriers of the hypomorphic single-nucleotide polymorphism.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The genetic findings and elevated circulating fatty-acid amides are consistent with a phenotype resulting from enhanced <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/endocannabinoid">endocannabinoid</a> signalling and a loss of function of FAAH.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Our results highlight previously unknown complexity at the <i>FAAH</i> genomic locus involving the expression of <i>FAAH-OUT</i>, a novel pseudogene and long non-coding RNA. These data suggest new routes to develop <i>FAAH</i>-based analgesia by targeting of <i>FAAH-OUT</i>, which could significantly improve the treatment of <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/postoperative-pain">postoperative pain</a> and potentially chronic pain and anxiety disorders.</p>
