<p>CureDAO is built on the <a href="https://client.aragon.org/#/pcuredao/">Aragon</a> DAO platform. The unit of democratic power in CureDAO is the PCUREDAO tokens on the Polygon blockchain.</p>
<p>PCUREDAO tokens give you control over CureDAO and how it allocates its resources.</p>
<p>PCUREDAO tokens are awarded for the completion of quests and experiments that advance the CureDAO mission. Quests and Experiments are outlined in ClickUp Tasks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They are founders' tokens that are used to track contributions prior to the public auction of our actual governance token.</p>
<p>The tokens are currently non-exchangeable, but function as equity distributed at our public genesis auction.</p>
<p>Following the auction, 10% of the real tokens are distributed proportionally to the pre-genesis token holders.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>### An example of returns to Pre-Genesis Contributors of a similar DAO:</h2>
<p>VitaDAO used the same approach as us, with 10% of their tokens distributed to the 20 pre-genesis contributors.</p>
<p>The price went up more than 300% over several months following the launch.</p>
<p>Based on the VITA price, this equates to more than $500k for each pre-genesis contributor for 6 months of part-time work</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
