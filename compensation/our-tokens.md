# ðŸª™ Quests and Tokens

CureDAO is built on the [Aragon](https://client.aragon.org/#/pcuredao/) DAO platform. The unit of democratic power in CureDAO is the PCUREDAO tokens on the Polygon blockchain.

PCUREDAO tokens give you control over CureDAO and how it allocates its resources.

PCUREDAO tokens are awarded for the completion of quests and experiments that advance the CureDAO mission. Quests and Experiments are outlined in Clickup Tasks.

They are founders' tokens that are used to track contributions prior to the public auction of our actual governance token. 
The tokens are currently non-exchangeable, but function as equity distributed at our public genesis auction.
Following the auction, 10% of the real tokens are distributed proportionally to the pre-genesis token holders.

### An example of returns to Pre-Genesis Contributors of a similar DAO:
VitaDAO used the same approach as us, with 10% of their tokens distributed to the 20 pre-genesis contributors.
The price went up more than 300% over several months following the launch. 
Based on the VITA price, this equates to more than $500k for each pre-genesis contributor for 6 months of part-time work
